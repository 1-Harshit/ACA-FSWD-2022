In the first assignment, I got to know how to create a repo, add files and commit them. But I'm still a little confused and I most probably think I didn't get the first assignment right. I learnt about various command lines.
In the second one, I learnt about various HTML and CSS  topics and tried to make a personal website using a very less number of the learnt things. I would like to get a little deeper and make something more interesting as time passes.
